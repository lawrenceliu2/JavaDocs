# JavaDocs Developer's Log

1/19/2016

-Removed the Graphs button, taking the project in a new direction.

-No code done, just discussion of how our project has changed.

-Instead of graphs that display information about the text (and honestly, there's only so much to display), we will focus on perfecting the text editor itself. Word count and such can perhaps be an extra button.

-Things to work on next: 1. Fonts and format button can change only a highlighted portion of the text. 2. Word count and other info button. 3. Other general text editor stuff and making the GUI look better.
